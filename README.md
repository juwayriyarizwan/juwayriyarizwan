Hi, my name is Juwayriya! As a recent computer science graduate, I have developed a passion for solving real-world problems with technology. 
I thrive in collaborative environments and am seeking challenging roles where I can apply and grow my software development skills. 
Currently, I'm building my personal website to showcase my projects and expand my skills through hands-on development.
